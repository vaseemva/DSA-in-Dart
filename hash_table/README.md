What is a Hash Table?
It is a generalized form of an array.
It stores the data in form of key-value pair.
It converts key to an index using hash function.
Taking the index we store key-value in array.
The primary operations supported by HashTable are -
get(key) - Get value for the provided key.
put(key, value) - Adds key-value pair against unique key.
remove(key) - Removes the key-value pair from HashTable
